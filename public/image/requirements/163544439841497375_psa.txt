open the project folder then right click, select git bash here. Then copy the command below

composer install --ignore-platform-reqs

Create copy of .env.example with name .env

This is your environment file which is required by laravel project

Open .env file and update this file with your MySQL Connection credentilas

After that run following command

php artisan key:generate

php artisan config:cache

composer dump-autoload

After that run your migration commands

php artisan migrate

Now Run your project with following command

php artisan serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Now you are done, you can browse project on

localhost:8000 | 127.0.0.1:8000 | 0.0.0.0:8000 | YOUR_IP:8000
I think this will help you out.
